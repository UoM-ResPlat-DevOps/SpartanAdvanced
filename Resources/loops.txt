# The following are simple examples of a "for" loop.
# Note the use of command substitution by using $(command); sometimes you will find the use of backticks instead (e.g., for i in * ; do mv $i `echo $i | tr "A-Z" "a-z"` ; done); this is not recommended.

for file in ./*.mp3 ; do ffmpeg -i "${file}" "${file/%mp3/ogg}" ; done
for item in ./*.jpeg ; do convert "$item" "${item%.*}.png" ; done
for item in ./*; do convert "$item" -define jpeg:extent=512kb "${item%.*}.jpg" ; done

# Loops can be applied in a step-wise manner.

$ cd ~/Genomics/shell_data
$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> head -n 2 ${filename} >> seq_info.txt
> done

# Basename in a loop.
# Basename is removing a uniform part of a name from a list of files. 
# In this case remove the .fastq extension and echo the output.

$ for filename in *.fastq
> do
> name=$(basename ${filename} .fastq)
> echo ${name}
> done

# What would happen if backticks were used instead of $() for shell substitution? What if someone mistook the backticks for single quotes?

for item in ./* ; do mv $item $(echo $item | tr "A-Z" "a-z") ; done

# What's wrong with spaces in filenames?

touch "This is a long file name"
for item in $(ls ./*); do echo ${item}; done

# The following examples remove spaces from filenames and apostrophes. The script is designed to prevent expansion from the wildcard, but remember that a `mv` command will overwrite existing files that have the same name.

for item in ./*; do mv "$item" "$(echo "$item" | tr -d " ")"; done

# Finally a few simple examples of loops with conditional tests.

x=1; while [ $x -le 5 ]; do echo "While-do count up $x"; x=$(( $x + 1 )); done
x=5; until [ $x -le 0 ]; do echo "Until-do count down $x"; x=$(( $x - 1 )); done
x=1; until [ $x = 6 ]; do echo "Until-do count up $x"; x=$(( $x + 1 )); done

# A while loop that reads in data from a file and runs a command on that data.
# This is what we used to originally set quotas on home and project directories.
# The 'read' command reads one line from standard input or a specified file.

while read line; do sleep 5; ./setquota.sh $line; done < quotalist.txt

# when searching for lines that contain a particular sequence in a file (e.g., from grep), reading those lines for processing can be accomplished with the something like the following:

grep sequence datafile.dat | while read -r line ; do   
    echo "Processing $line"   
    # Processing code #   
done   

# Curly braces are used to encapsulate statements or variables with {} or ${}

var		# Set a variable
$var		# Invoke the variable
${var}bar	# Invoke the variable, append "bar".

# Example of determining jobs running on a set of nodes.

for host in "spartan-rc"{001..10}; do squeue -w $host; done
